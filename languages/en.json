Since then, I've been working on various personal projects to hone my skills and gain practical experience.<br><br>I'm a self-starter who's always eager to learn and take on new challenges. I enjoy working collaboratively with designers, developers, and other stakeholders to create user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. I have experience with popular front-end frameworks like Angular, and I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest web technologies.<br><br>Outside of coding, I love travelling. I've visited many countries and I've lived in Germany, United States and Australia (apart from Spain).
